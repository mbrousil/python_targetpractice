Install gcloud!

https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

Follow the instructions. You'll need python for this. My suggestion is the following:
1) download and install homebrew
> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
(my use of '>' here indicates lines to run in your terminal)

2) install python3.8
> brew install python@3.8 
M1 macs need to load 3.8 (not the latest release) otherwise some packages won't load. Follow any update instructions

3) go to the link above and follow the directions
